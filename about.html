      <h3>About Robert McVicar</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        I'm a burgeoning web developer with an interest in creating responsive, functioning websites that communicate their message clearly and aesthetically. I believe that from a business perspective, having a website be conceptually integrated into marketing and advertising goals is critical in achieving desirable results. A good website is an essential asset in conveying a strong, cohesive message to any audience.

        You might be wondering why you have seen a discrepancy here in the way my last name is spelled. It's truly spelled 'McVicar,' not 'MCVICXR.' Turns out there already is not just another McVicar out there in the world, but another... ROB MCVICAR. Blew my mind too. He played goalie in the NHL and you can read about him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_McVicar" target="_blank">here.</a> Anyways, registering my (our?) name anywhere online wasn't easy, but I made it work by adding numbers at at the end of it. I wasn't a big fan of that.

        I spend fair amount of time on Soundcloud listening to weird beats that people make. If you think you might enjoy melodic trap beats too, you can check out my profile <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mcvicxr" target="_blank">here.</a> About a year ago, it was popular amongst the inhabitants of this particular online community to write their handles in all caps and replace a letter or two with a V or an X. It achieved a Roman numeral-esque type of thing. I thought about it and decided my last name would look cool if I wrote it in all caps and ditched the a for an x. It's basically unpronouncable. Still, I ran with it. You can find me on PSN @MCVICXR, or on Twitter tweeting non-sequiturs <a href="https://twitter.com/MCVICXR" target="_blank">@MCVICXR.</a>

        When I'm not working or sitting in front of a screen, I like to ride my bike, fly my little quadcopter drone, study German, buy clothes, stay up on current events, hit the gym, and spend time with friends and family.
