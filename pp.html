      <h3>The Pet Penguin</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Pet Penguin was the first website I ever worked on, and as far as actual coding goes, I didn't do much of it. At least not at the beginning. At the time, I was largely inspired by the success of websites like the now defunct Grantland and Vice, and I wanted to try and do something similar. (It took me some time to discover how much I would not enjoy trying to write articles for the web.) One hazy night, I shared the idea with my friend Ryan and we decided to go to work on it.

        I knew page layout thanks to prior experience in Adobe InDesign, so I did wireframes. Ryan knew more about code than I did, so he used my wireframes to do mockups in Adobe Fireworks and then started constructing the website in Dreamweaver. It was a fun project, but at the end of the day we didn't really know what we were doing. We had trouble figuring out how to get the site actually hosted and live, and the reality of producing content on a regular basis without being paid reared its ugly head. We both had day jobs, I was still in school, and I was also doing freelance work on the side. We eventually stopped working on it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Around January of 2014, I decided to take another stab at the website. I opened up the files and started reading through the code. The intro to HTML class I took in 2008 at community college served me surprisingly well. I gained a basic understanding of how the website's code and created an alternate layout, but I eventaully reverted it back to the original layout. I researched hosting services and chose one called DreamHost. Through a lot of trial and error, I figured out how to host a website, link my pages together, and use a FTP client, and also learned about how to understand a file directory.

      <p>
        I recently saved the The Pet Penguin to a Github repo. As much as I was tempted to, I didn't alter the original code, but I did fix broken links so that it would at least work. The website, or the articles written by your truly, aren't the best, but it serves as a reminder of where I started out.
