      <h3>I Bought a Book</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        When I started my current job, I knew something had to be done about our website. It's not a bad website; it's simple and looks nice, but it hadn't been updated in a very long time. Simply put, it's dated. I knew I had to get the ball rolling on updating it. I could access it and change a few lines of text here and there, but the business itself required a more extensive overhaul on the website than just updated contact information. I wanted to be the one that did it, but my very limited understanding of basic HTML wasn't going to be enough. So I ordered a book.

        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1450342885&sr=1-1&keywords=html+and+css" target="_blank">HTML &amp; CSS: How to Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett</a> arrived in the mail a few days later and I cracked it open and read the introduction. The author related building a website to doing page layout for print. Having experience with the latter really helped make things click conceptually and made learning the code a lot easier. I worked through the book at a steady pace, methodically typing out each of the examples given in order to train my brain and my fingers. I still made frustrating mistakes though, and with the new material, I didn't always know what I was supposed to be looking for to fix the problem. Learning a new subject without an instructor isn't always smooth sailing.

        Eventually I finished the book. Eager to test my abilites, I started to code my new website form the ground up. It worked well and looked decent and I was extremely pleased with myself. I thought I was set and ready to move on and build an amazing, modern, new company website until I spent some time visiting websites I liked and viewing their source code. I started to recognize a lot of unfamiliar code, but it wasn't JavaScript or another language. It was HTML and CSS. A feeling of dread washed over me as I realized that I had only dented the surface of what I needed and what to learn. I had figured out how to build a great static website with semantic HTML, but I still had no idea how to build a truly modern website that meets industry standards.

        HTML &amp; CSS helped me building a solid, but basic understanding of the two coding languages. Overall it's a great, introductory book on the subject, one I still keep on my shelf as a reference. However, I realized that I had a lot more ahead of me if I was going to be able to build the type of website that I wanted to.
