      <h3>Freelancing, Part I - The Pilates Manual</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        During my last year at UW, I started working a part time office job. It wasn't a place I saw myself at in the long term, and was actively looking for new work. I was browsing Craiglist one day and found a listing under "Gigs" in the writing section from a woman that ran a pilates studio. She needed an instructional manual put together. I was on newspaper staff in high school, and the paper was put together in Adobe InDesign. I knew I could put something using the same methods, so I contacted her and she said I had the job.

        I was given a thumbdrive full of photos that would need to be sized down in Photoshop and a pile of papers that I would have to transcribe. At first glance I realzied that it was a substantial amount of material, but wasn't really aware of the long nights that I ahead of me. After I transcribed the material from paper into a Word doc, I did the basic page layout in InDesign. From there, it turned into a copy and paste marathon; a tedious process of placing text in text boxes and resizing and respacing as needed. The majority of the pages also had two corresponding images that had to be reformatted and resized in Photoshop.

        Balancing this project with school and my job wasn't terribly hard, but it did result in some very long days. The biggest issue was finding someplace to work late into the night. The libraries at UW closed at 11pm, weren't very accessible, didn't have food and drink. Working at home had the comforts, but I knew better than to try and get anything done there when I could just lay down in bed. This led to my discovery of working in bars. Think about it. They're open late, most have wi-fi, some serve food and they all definitely serve drinks. The trick was to find the right ones that that had cheap pints of PBR, food or snacks, decent wi-fi and most importantly the right kind of atmosphere. You can't post up on your laptop and work for several hours in just any bar.

        After a few long nights in poorly lit establsihments, I completed the layout. The manual ended up being close to three-hundred pages long with a table of contents and an index at the end of it. The final step was to print out seven sets of the PDF and assemble them into one-inch binders. At this point I was working against the clock. They had to be delivered early next morning, and for whatever reason my computer and printer decied to stop talking to each other. I don't remember how, but I got it too work, and I hole-punched my night away.

        The product got delivered and I got paid. Earning an extra couple hundred bucks as a college student was awesome, but I was super burned out by the end of it. Juggling a full class load, a part time job, and a feelance project wasn't sustainable in the long term. While it wasn't that fun to do, it did teach me how to collect, organize, copyedit, and arrange a large amount of content. The project required more organization than creativty. Looking back at it, I wish I had at least gone with a different font. Three hundred pages of Times New Roman got the point across, it was an instructional manual after all, but in retrospect it looks pretty amateur.
